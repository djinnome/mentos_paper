<div>Where&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k_+\)</span>and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k_-\)</span>&nbsp; are the rate constants of the forward and the reverse reaction, respectively.&nbsp; To solve for the&nbsp; two unknown rate constants, we need two equations. The first equation comes from the definition of the net flux :</div>
