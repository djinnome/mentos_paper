Here, we formalize the concept of extracting energy from the environment as quickly and efficiently as possible. Assume a metabolic network that  To extract energy efficiently, the free energy change for the overall reaction should be distributed as evenly as possible both across each pa


For a metabolic network, we define the probability that a reaction $i$ will fire in the forward  direction ${\mathcal P_{+i}}$ by normalizing its forward thermodynamic driving force by the sum of all forward and backward driving forces in the metabolic network. Similarly, we define the probability that reaction $i$ will fire in the backward direction $\mathcal P_{-i}$ by normalizing its backward thermodynamic force by  the sum of all forward and backward driving forces in the metabolic network
