## Probability distribution of the reactions in a metabolic network ##
We define the probability that a reaction in the metabolic network will fire by normalizing the thermodynamic driving force of each reaction by the sum of all forward and backward driving forces:

In this context, the thermodynamic driving force is simply the unnormalized likelihood, or $L_+
