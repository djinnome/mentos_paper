<div>There is an important relationship between the net rate&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\( \Delta r=r_+ - r_-\)</span> and the net thermodynamic force.&nbsp; For a single reaction, the likelihood that the reaction will fire in the forward direction is given its thermodynamic force,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(L_+=r_+/r_-\)</span>, and the likelihood that it will fire in the backward direction is&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(L_- = r_-/r_+\)</span></div><div>Recall that the forward thermodynamic force&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(e^{\mathcal A/RT} = r_+/r_-\)</span> and the backward thermodynamic force&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(e^{-\mathcal A/RT} = r_-/r_+\)</span>. Then,</div>
