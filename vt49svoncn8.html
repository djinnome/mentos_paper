<div>There is an important relationship between the net rate&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\( \Delta r=r_+ - r_-\)</span> and the net thermodynamic force.&nbsp; Recall the thermodyamic force in the forward direction is the ln&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(L_+=r_+/r_-\)</span>, and the likelihood that it will fire in the backward direction is&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(L_- = r_-/r_+\)</span></div><div>Then the net likelihood&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta L = L_+ - L_-\)</span></div>
