<div>There is an important relationship between the net rate&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\( \Delta r=r_+ - r_-\)</span> and the net thermodynamic force.&nbsp; Recall the thermodyamic force in the forward direction is the likelihood ratio of the forward and backward rates&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(e^{\mathcal A/RT} = r_+/r_- = L_+\)</span>, and the thermodynamic force in the backward direction is the likelihood ratio of the backwards and forward rates&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(e^{-\mathcal A/RT} = r_-/r_+ = L_-\)</span></div><div>Then the net likelihood ratio&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta L = L_+ - L_-\)</span> can be defined in terms of the net rate</div>
