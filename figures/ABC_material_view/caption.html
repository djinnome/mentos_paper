<div data-label="281473">MENTOS prediction of the difference between the likelihood ratio of forward and backward rates and the likelihood ratio of backward and forward rates(edges) and log concentrations (nodes).&nbsp; Net likelihoods satisfy the steady-state constraint, and are proportional to the fluxes that are predicted to be associated with these metabolite concentrations</div>
