<div data-label="732586"><b>Elementary modes of ABC model.</b>&nbsp; The first elementary mode generates 1 mole of D for every mole of A. The second elementary mode generates 0.5 moles of D and a for every mole of A. The third elementary mode generates 2 moles of D for every mole of A and E.. Every steady-state flux distribution is a nonnegative linear combination of these three elementary modes.</div>
